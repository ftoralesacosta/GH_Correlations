comment: This paper presents isolated photon--hadron correlations usingpp and p$-$Pb
  data collected by the ALICE detector at the LHC. For photons with $|\eta|<0.67$
  and $12 < p_\mathrm{T} < 40$ GeV/$c$, the associated yield of charged particles
  in the range {$|\eta|<0.80$} and $0.5 < p_\mathrm{T} < 10$ GeV/$c$ is presented.
  These momenta are much lower than previous measurements at the LHC. No significant
  difference between pp and p$-$Pb is observed, with Pythia 8.2 describing both data
  sets within uncertainties. This measurement constrains nuclear effects on the parton
  fragmentation in p$-$Pb collisions, and provides a benchmark for future studies
  of Pb$-$Pb collisions.

description: $\gamma^\mathrm{iso}$-hadron correlation functions for pp (red) and p$-$Pb
  (blue) data at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV as measured by the ALICE detector.
  The different panels represent three different $z_\mathrm{T}$ bins. The correlation
  functions are projected over the range $|\Delta\eta| < 1.2$. The darker bands at
  zero represents the uncertainty from the underlying event estimation in pp and p$-$Pb.
  The underlying event was estimated over the range $|0.4 <\Delta\varphi < 1.6|$.
  The vertical bars represent statistical uncertainties only. The boxes indicate the
  systematic uncertainties. The dashed green line represents the $\gamma^\mathrm{iso}$-hadron
  correlation function obtained with PYTHIA 8.2 Monash Tune. '$p$' is the p-value
  for the hypothesis that the pp and p$-$Pb data follow the same true correlation
  function.

  detector. The boxes represent the systematic uncertainties while the vertical bars
  indicate the statistical uncertainties. The dashed green line corresponds to PYTHIA
  8.2 Monash Tune. The $\chi^2$ test for the comparison of pp and p$-$Pb data incorporates
  correlations among different $z_\mathrm{T}$ intervals. A constant that was fit to
  the ratio is shown as grey band, with the width indicating the uncertainty on the
  fit.
